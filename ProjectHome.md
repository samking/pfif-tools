This package provides tools to validate PFIF XML, to test client-repository interoperability, to test repository-repository interoperability, to compare outputs for testing, and to make a test data set.

The PFIF format is described at http://zesty.ca/pfif/

All of these tools can be accessed at http://pfif-tools.appspot.com/
