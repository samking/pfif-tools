To ensure client-repo API compatibility, you should run the Client Repo Interoperability Tests.

The web frontend is at http://pfif-tools.appspot.com/client_test

1)  If write\_url is provided and the Add Test Data to Repo box is checked, the data generated by Make Test Data will be added to your repository.

2)  Run all of the client tests identified at https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/1HoCtiKjmp6j2d4d2U9QBJtehuVoANcWc6ggxthacPRY/edit?hl=en_US&authkey=CMaK1qsI.  If you do not provide a URL for a test, it will not be run.

3)  The results are output.  The results are a PFIF Diff between the desired output and the actual output from the API, or a message if the test could not be run.

On the command line tool and on the web frontend, there are the same options as there were for make\_test\_data.  The user must also provide any API URLs that they want to be tested.  A description of the templating syntax used for these URLs is available on the client\_test page or, on the command line tool, by asking for --verbose-help.
