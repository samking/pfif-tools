Make Test Data allows you to create the test data set identified here: https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/1HoCtiKjmp6j2d4d2U9QBJtehuVoANcWc6ggxthacPRY/edit?hl=en_US&authkey=CMaK1qsI

It is mainly used within the interoperability tests to add data to the repository and to generate reference data to test your repository against, so there is no web frontend.

Options to specify are described with make-test\_data.py -h, but there are also debug options that let you create a smaller data set.  If you want to create only record 50, you could pass --first-person=50 --last-person=50.  If you only want to create notes n3005 to n3010, you can pass --first-person-with-notes=30 --last-person-with-notes=30 --first-note=5 --last-note=10.  --all-notes-are-top-level is used to prevent embedding notes within persons, which will cause notes that are not embedded within a person to be lost.
